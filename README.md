# hello-world
My First Repository! 
Hi my name is Julie Kropp and I'm a mom of two.  I live in Orlando, Fl.  I have been teaching myself how to code online.  My goal is to freelance or work for a company in Orlando.  Front End Development is my goal.  I would love to get great at HTML, CSS, Javascript and wordpress.  I love how the possibilities are endless in this industry!
